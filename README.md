## Project structure

My sdl2 setup is located [here](https://github.com/ingakv/sdlpain)

The code is run with `cabal run gogame-exe`

The main file (Main.hs) is located in the `app` folder

The libraries are in the `src` folder:

1. Common.hs
   - Copied from example code by Mariusz
   - Is used for SDL2 to properly work
2. DataTypes.hs
   - Contains all the datatypes:
     - Intent
     - World
     - Slot (Empty / White / Black)
3. Draw.hs
   - All the functions relating to rendering and drawing something to the screen, including:
     - Text
     - The world
     - UI
     - The board itself
     - The stones
     - The background
   - Also contains the mainApp function
4. GameLogic.hs
   - Contains everything related to the game mechanics, including:
     - Deleting, inserting and joining together stones and groups
     - Checking free slots
     - Checking the stones that are adjacent to a given stone
   - Also contains a few smaller functions I made that are used throughout the project, such as `replace` and `insertAt`
5. Lib.hs
   - Contains all functions relating to intent (motion, button, payload, apply)
   - Contains all functions that don't fit into the other libraries, such as:
     - Initializing the board and world
     - Updating the world
     - Mouse coordinates and placement

The textures are in the `assets` folder:

- Background
- Board
- Black and White stones
- Stones when the mouse is hovering over a slot
  - Are the above png files at 50% opacity
- A few PhotoShop files are also included for when I wanted to tweak something about a certain texture as I progressed in the assignment
- The commit message syntax is also in there for easy access for myself, but I will most likely not remove it as it can be useful to keep there

The font I used is in the `ttf` folder

### Testing

The test file `Spec.hs` is located in the test folder

The test [succeeded](test/gogame-0.1.0.0-gogame-test.log)

## Requirements specification

**Feature specification**

* Visualizing a Go board
* Doing moves and updating the board according to Go rules
* Loading board state from SGF files.
* Representing groups on the board
* Counting groups and degrees of freedom
* Updating the board state via computer-generated moves
* Ability to detect illegal game moves
* Ability to properly capture stones

**Implemented features**

* The program automatically captures (groups of) stones when surrounded
* Which player / color that is active alternates each time a stone is placed
* A stone cannot be placed on top of another stone
* A stone can only be placed within the board
* Self-capture / suicide is not possible
* When hovering over an available intersection, a semi-transparent stone with the correct color will be shown.
* UI using SDL2, including

  * Textures

    * The board
    * The background
    * The stones
  * Lines
  * Numbers and letters to easily identify each intersection
  * A visual describing the number of groups, as well as the degree of freedom, for each player
* Start an empty board on startup
* Skips turn by pressing 's'
* Quit the application when pressing 'q' or the ESC button
* Clear the board by pressing 'c'
* Can load board states from an SGF file, however, the format of this file is not up to standard, and does instead only consist of an array of 'E's, 'W's and 'B's, which stands for Empty, White and Black

**Not implemented features**

* Ko is not implemented and an infinite loop of capture and recapture is possible
  * I chose to not implement KO as I feel like it would be one of the more advanced features. The way I would have done it is by storing two copies of the board before any change was made to it. So board_1 would be how the board was one turn ago, and board_2 would be how it was two rounds ago. When a stone was attempted to be placed. I would then check if the board was back to how it looked in one of the two previous rounds. If it was, the stone would not be able to be placed
* Reading from SGF file is not done the "correct" way
  * It should be able to read an SGF file quickly and check whether it exists.
* Cannot save a game / board to SGF file
  * I have not been able to completely learn how to implement reading from and writing to an SGF file because of time issues. But the implementation would be done by adjusting the already implemented code for reading from an SGF / text file
* Should also have at least 50% test coverage.
